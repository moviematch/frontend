# Movie Match Frontend - public repository

This is the publicly available source code for the Movie Match frontend - read more about the project [here](https://jonathan-kings.com/moviematch).

Please note - this public version of the code is slightly altered from what's actually used in the app. In particular:
- The Dart API client (generated from the OpenAPI definition) has been stripped; the OpenAPI file is available [here](https://jonathan-kings.com/movie-match), though.
- Firebase and Admob project info has been removed.
